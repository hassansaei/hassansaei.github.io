	abstract = {Glycogen storage diseases ({GSDs}) are the heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations in at least 30 different genes. Different types of {GSDs}, especially liver {GSDs}, take overlapping symptoms and can be clinically indistinguishable. This survey evaluated the use of whole-exome sequencing ({WES}) for the genetic analysis of the liver {GSD}-suspected patients in three unrelated families. An in-house filtering pipeline was used to assess rare pathogenic variants in {GSD}-associated genes, autosomal recessive/mendelian disorder genes (carrier status for genetic counseling subjects), and the {ACMG}’s list of 59 actionable genes. For the interpretation of the causative variants and the incidental/secondary findings, {ACMG} guidelines were applied. Additionally, we have explored {PharmGKB} class {IA}/{IB} pharmacogenetic variants. The segregation analysis was performed using Sanger sequencing for the novel causative variants. Bioinformatics analysis of the exome data in three individuals revealed three novel homozygous causative variants in the {GSD}-associated genes. The first variant, c.298\_307delATGATCAACC in {PYGL} gene has related to {HERS} disease ({GSD} {VI}). Both variants of c.1043dupT and c.613-1G \&gt; C in {SLC}2A2 gene have been associated with Fanconi-Bickel syndrome ({GSDXI}). Eight pathogenic/likely pathogenic medical actionable findings in Mendelian disease genes and 10 pharmacogenetic variants with underlying drug response phenotypes have been identified. No known/expected pathogenic variants were detected in the {ACMG}’s list of 59 actionable genes. The logical filtering steps can help in finding other medical actionable secondary/incidental findings as well as effectively identifying the causative variants in heterogeneous conditions such as {GSDs}. Three novel variants related to {GSD} genes recognized in liver {GSD}-suspected patients with early infantile and childhood-age onset.},
