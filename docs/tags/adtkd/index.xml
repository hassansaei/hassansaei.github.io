      <description>Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a hereditary condition characterized by progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis with or without tubular dilation and atrophy, eventually leading to end-stage kidney failure. The affected individuals present mild to negative proteinuria, and bland urinary sediment abnormalities, with normal kidney size. A positive family history is commonly reported for this disease. Molecular genetics play a key role in diagnosing and classifying ADTKD given their non-specific presentations. Pathogenic variants in different genes, including MUC1, UMOD, HNF1B, REN, and SEC61A1, are known to be responsible for ADTKD.</description>
