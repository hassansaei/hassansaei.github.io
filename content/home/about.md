\ 

I am a human geneticist with a strong interest and experience in genomics and computational analysis of genomic data to diagnose and understand hereditary diseases. My research focuses on identifying and characterizing genetic variants associated with inherited disorders using patient-derived data and disease models. I am currently working at the Laboratory of Hereditary Renal Diseases at the Imagine Institute in Paris. My goal is to integrate genomic analysis with functional modeling to advance genetic diagnostics and develop gene therapies.
