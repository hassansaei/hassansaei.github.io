\ 

My research focuses on identifying and characterizing genetic variants associated with hereditary diseases. Currently, I am working at the Laboratory of Hereditary Renal Diseases, directed by Prof. Corinne Antignac, at the Imagine Institute in Paris. My interests lie in advancing genetic diagnostics and developing robust disease models to facilitate variant characterization and therapy development.
